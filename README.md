# Four-Legged Friend Finder

This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application that matches people and dogs based on their compatibility. This full-stack site takes in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users (dogs to humans, humans to dogs). The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

It is currently deployed on [Heroku.](https://thawing-garden-86806.herokuapp.com/)
