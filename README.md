# Four-Legged Friend Finder

This is a full-stack application that matches people and dogs based on their compatibility. The site takes in results from users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users (dogs are compared to humans, humans to dogs). The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match to current user's data.

The site is currently deployed on [Heroku.](https://thawing-garden-86806.herokuapp.com/) It was built using node and express. The styling is primarily Bootstrap with a little personalized css mixed in.

The video here will walk you through how the app works: [Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eHmTJ15Zq44gsXKV1ptSu2ct2DBLOoAB/view)
